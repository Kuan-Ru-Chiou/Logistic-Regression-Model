# Logistic-Regression-Model

# Data Preprocessing:

1. Importing the required Libraries:

2. Importing the Data Set:

3. Handling the Missing Data:

4. Encoding Categorial Data: Categorial data are variables that contain label values rather than numerical values. 
                             Example values such as Yes and No cannot be used in mathematical equations of the model
                             so we need to encode these variables into numbers. 
                             To achieve this we import LabelEncoder class from sklearn.preprocessing library.

5. Splitting the dataset into test set and training set:

6. Feature scaling: Most of the machine learning algorithms use the Euclidean distance between two data points in their computation,
                    features highly varying in magnitudes, units and range pose problems.
                    High magnitudes features will weigh more in the distance calculations than features with low magnitudes.
                    Done by Feature standardization or Z-score normalization. StandardScalar of sklearn.preprocessing is imported.
